    <!--I want to talk a little bit about how we can set up our HTML page so that we have good responsive design. So right now nothing much is going on. You can see here that I can adjust the screen size. 
But we don't have much happening on our page. So if we go back to the Bootstrap documentation in the quick start guide if I scroll all the way to the bottom you see that I get a starter template here 
and you might notice here something that we haven't seen before which is this part over here called a "required meta tag" and you can see here that this is actually something that we can copy and paste and place right below our title here.-->
